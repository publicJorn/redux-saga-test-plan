Saga Test Plan\n\n\n\nPowerful test helpers for Redux Saga.\nRedux Saga Test Plan makes testing sagas a breeze. Whether you need to test\nexact effects and their ordering or just test your saga put's a specific\naction at some point, Redux Saga Test Plan has you covered.\nRedux Saga Test Plan aims to embrace both unit testing and integration testing\napproaches to make testing your sagas easy.\nIntegration Testing\nRequires global Promise to be available\nOne downside to unit testing sagas is that it couples your test to your\nimplementation. Simple reordering of yielded effects in your saga could break\nyour tests even if the functionality stays the same. If you're not concerned\nwith the order or exact effects your saga yields, then you can take a\nintegrative approach, testing the behavior of your saga when run by Redux Saga.\nThen, you can simply test that a particular effect was yielded during the saga\nrun. For this, use the expectSaga test function.\nSimple Example\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction identity(value) {\n  return value;\n}\n\nfunction* mainSaga(x, y) {\n  const action = yield take('HELLO');\n\n  yield put({ type: 'ADD', payload: x + y });\n  yield call(identity, action);\n}\n\nit('just works!', () => {\n  return expectSaga(mainSaga, 40, 2)\n    // assert that the saga will eventually yield `put`\n    // with the expected action\n    .put({ type: 'ADD', payload: 42 })\n\n    // dispatch any actions your saga will `take`\n    .dispatch({ type: 'HELLO' })\n\n    // run it\n    .run();\n});\n\nExample with Reducer\nimport { expectSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nconst HAVE_BIRTHDAY = 'HAVE_BIRTHDAY';\nconst AGE_BEFORE = 'AGE_BEFORE';\nconst AGE_AFTER = 'AGE_AFTER';\n\nconst initialDog = {\n  name: 'Tucker',\n  age: 11,\n};\n\nfunction dogReducer(state = initialDog, action) {\n  if (action.type === HAVE_BIRTHDAY) {\n    return {\n      ...state,\n      age: state.age + 1,\n    };\n  }\n\n  return state;\n}\n\nfunction getAge(state) {\n  return state.age;\n}\n\nfunction* saga() {\n  const ageBefore = yield select(getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: AGE_BEFORE, payload: ageBefore });\n\n  yield take(HAVE_BIRTHDAY);\n\n  const ageAfter = yield select(getAge);\n\n  yield put({ type: AGE_AFTER, payload: ageAfter });\n}\n\nit('handles reducers', () => {\n  return expectSaga(saga)\n    .withReducer(dogReducer)\n\n    .put({ type: AGE_BEFORE, payload: 11 })\n    .put({ type: AGE_AFTER, payload: 12 })\n\n    .dispatch({ type: HAVE_BIRTHDAY })\n\n    .run();\n});\n\nYes, it's that simple to test with expectSaga.\nUnit Testing\nIf you want to ensure that your saga yields specific types of effects in a\nparticular order, then you'll want to use the testSaga function. Here's a\nsimple example:\nimport { testSaga } from 'redux-saga-test-plan';\n\nfunction identity(value) {\n  return value;\n}\n\nfunction* mainSaga(x, y) {\n  const action = yield take('HELLO');\n\n  yield put({ type: 'ADD', payload: x + y });\n  yield call(identity, action);\n}\n\nconst action = { type: 'TEST' };\n\nit('works with unit tests', () => {\n  testSaga(mainSaga, 40, 2);\n    // advance saga with `next()`\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga yields `take` with `'HELLO'` as type\n    .take('HELLO')\n\n    // pass back in a value to a saga after it yields\n    .next(action)\n\n    // assert that the saga yields `put` with the expected action\n    .put({ type: 'ADD', payload: 42 })\n\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga yields a `call` to `identity` with\n    // the `action` argument\n    .call(identity, action)\n\n    .next()\n\n    // assert that the saga is finished\n    .isDone();\n});\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\nGetting Started\nIntegration Testing\nEffect Creators\nDispatching\nTimeout\nState\nMocking\nPartial Matching\nNegated Assertions\nForked Sagas\n\n\nUnit Testing\nError Messages\nEffect Creators\nSaga Helpers\nGeneral Assertions\nTime Travel\n\n\n\n"},"getting-started.html":{"url":"getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\nInstall\nThe recommended way to install redux-saga-test-plan is with a package manager\nlike yarn or npm.\nyarn\nyarn add redux-saga-test-plan --dev\nnpm\nnpm install --save-dev redux-saga-test-plan\n"},"integration-testing/":{"url":"integration-testing/","title":"Integration Testing","keywords":"","body":"Integration Testing\nRequires global Promise to be available\nFor integration testing, Redux Saga Test Plan exports an expectSaga function\nthat returns an API for asserting that a saga yields certain effects. To use\nexpectSaga, pass in your generator function as the first argument. Pass in\nadditional arguments which will be the arguments passed on to the generator\nfunction.\nexpectSaga runs your saga with Redux Saga's runSaga function, so it will run\njust like it would in your application. This also means your saga will likely\nrun asynchronously, so expectSaga will also be asynchronous.\nAfter calling expectSaga on your saga and making some assertions, you can\nstart the saga with the run method. The run method will return a Promise,\nthat you can then use with your favorite testing framework. If any assertions\nfail, then expectSaga will reject the returned Promise. If all assertions\npass, then the Promise will resolve.\nLook at the example below that uses Jest as\nthe testing framework. Notice that we return the Promise so Jest knows when\nthe test completes.

These helpers come in two flavors.\nYour sagas can delegate (i.e. use yield*) to these helpers if you import them\ndirectly from the redux-saga module. This is now a deprecated pattern\naccording to Redux Saga. You are encouraged to now import the equivalent effect\ncreators for these helpers from the redux-saga/effects module and just yield\nthem like other effect creators. Redux Saga still supports delegating to the\nhelpers, but if it removes support for delegation, then Redux Saga Test Plan\nwill also necessarily remove support for testing delegations.\nTo decide which assertions you need for testing your saga, please review the\npossibilities below:\n\nIf you are using the helper effect creators from redux-saga/effects, you\ncan use the respective methods takeEveryEffect, takeLatestEffect, and\nthrottleEffect from Redux Saga Test Plan.\n\nIf your saga delegates to any of these helpers from redux-saga directly,\nthen you can use the respective takeEvery, takeLatest, and throttle\nmethods from Redux Saga Test Plan. The difference between these assertions\nand the normal effect creator assertions is that you shouldn't call next on\nyour test saga beforehand. These methods will automatically advance the saga\nfor you.\nDEPRECATION NOTICE:Delegating is now a deprecated pattern for Redux Saga. Please move to using\nthe effect creators added in Redux Saga\nv0.14.0.\nIf Redux Saga removes this pattern, then Redux Saga Test Plan will also\nremove the respective assertion methods.\n\nStarting in Redux Saga\nv0.12.0,\ninstead of delegating to the helpers from the redux-saga module, you could\ninstead yield them like normal effect creators such as call or put. These\nare non-blocking yields; internally, Redux Saga will fork them like the\nnormal fork effect creator. If you yield instead of delegating, then you\ncan use the respective takeEveryFork, takeLatestFork, and throttleFork\nmethods from Redux Saga Test Plan. Because these assertions are like the\nnormal effect creator assertions, you WILL need to call next prior to\nthese assertions.\nDEPRECATION NOTICE:Because these are the same helpers you can delegate to, this pattern may also\nbe removed by Redux Saga, meaning Redux Saga Test Plan will also remove the\nrespective assertion methods.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nHelper\nEffect Creator\nDelegating
